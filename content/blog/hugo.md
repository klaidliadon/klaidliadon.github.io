I finally moved my website to [Hugo](http://gohugo.io). I am using a fork of the [Hello Friend NG](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng/) theme.

Hugo is a powerful static website generator built in Go. It uses and extends the template package, allowing to create websites in minutes.
